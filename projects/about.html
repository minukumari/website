      <h1 align=center style="padding-top:10px;">Elements of Painting</h1>
      <h2>Color and tone</h2>
      <div class="div8">
      <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Chen_Hongshou%2C_leaf_album_painting.jpg/800px-Chen_Hongshou%2C_leaf_album_painting.jpg"
      alt="Chen Hongshou" title="Chen Hongshou" class="img2">
      Color and tone are the essence of painting as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music.
      Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next.
      Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists,
      including Goethe,[3] Kandinsky,[4] and Newton,[5] have written their own color theory.
      Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word "red", for example, can cover a wide range of variations
       from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light.
      There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as F or C♯. For a painter,
      color is not simply divided into basic (primary)
      and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.).
       </p>
     </div>
     <h2>Non-traditional elements</h2>
     <div class="div8">
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Georges_Seurat_066.jpg/220px-Georges_Seurat_066.jpg"
         alt="Circus Sideshow" title="Circus Sideshow" class="img2">
         Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, as one example, collage, which began with Cubism and is not painting in the strict sense.
         Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand, cement, straw or wood for their texture.
         Examples of this are the works of Jean Dubuffet and Anselm Kiefer. There is a growing community of artists who use computers to "paint" color onto a digital "canvas"
         using programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel Painter, and many others.
         These images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required.</p>
     </div>
     <h2>Rhythm</h2>
     <div class="div8">
       <p>Rhythm is important in painting as it is in music. If one defines rhythm as "a pause incorporated into a sequence",
       then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations—form, melody,
       coloration. The distribution of form, or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art,
       and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetical value is functionality dependent,
       i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty.
        Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of "techne", directly contributes to the aesthetical value.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <div class="div8">
      <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Lascaux_04.jpg/220px-Lascaux_04.jpg"
      alt="Cave painting of aurochs" title="Cave painting of aurochs" class="img2">
      The oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, which some historians believe are about 32,000 years old.
      They are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment, and they show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth,
      abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures. However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been
      discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land, in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there
      are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved
      in a limestone rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old.[7]
      There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia, Mexico,[8] etc.
      In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter.
      In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.
    </p>
  </div>
      <h2>Aesthetics and theory</h2>
      <div class="div8">
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Formella_18%2C_apelle_o_la_pittura%2C_nino_pisano%2C_1334-1336_dettaglio_01.JPG/170px-Formella_18%2C_apelle_o_la_pittura%2C_nino_pisano%2C_1334-1336_dettaglio_01.JPG"
          alt="Apelles or the Art of painting"
          title="Apelles or the Art of painting" class="img2">
          Aesthetics is the study of art and beauty; it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as Kant and
          Hegel. Classical philosophers like Plato and Aristotle also theorized about art and painting in particular.
          Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the
          truth—it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a craft, similar to shoemaking or iron
          casting.[citation needed] By the time of Leonardo, painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was
          in Ancient Greece. Leonardo da Vinci, on the contrary, said that "Italian: La Pittura è cosa mentale"
          ("English: painting is a thing of the mind").[9] Kant distinguished between Beauty and the Sublime, in terms that clearly
          gave priority to the former.[citation needed] Although he did not refer to painting in particular,
          this concept was taken up by painters such as J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h1 style="padding-left:10px;">Painting media</h1>
      <div class="div8">
        <p>
          Different types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in,
          which determines the general working characteristics of the paint, such as viscosity, miscibility, solubility, drying time, etc.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Oil</h2>
      <div class="div8">
        <p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Honor%C3%A9_Daumier_008.jpg/220px-Honor%C3%A9_Daumier_008.jpg"
          alt="Honoré Daumier" title="Oil on panel with visible brushstrokes" class="img2" />
          Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil, such as linseed oil, which
          was widely used in early modern Europe. Often the oil was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even frankincense;
          these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss.
          Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Pastel</h2>
      <div class="div8">
        <p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Louis15-1.jpg/220px-Louis15-1.jpg"
          alt="Maurice Quentin de La Tour" title="Portrait of Louis XV of France" class="img2"/>
          Pastel is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.
          The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints;
          the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than
          that of any other process.[19] Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation
          requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a fixative.
          Nonetheless, when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for, a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Acrylic</h2>
      <div class="div8">
        <p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Jungle_Arc.jpg/220px-Jungle_Arc.jpg"
          alt="Jungle Arc" title="Jungle Arc" class="img2" />
          Acrylic paint is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted
          with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with
          acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own
          unique characteristics not attainable with other media.
          The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time.
        </p>
     </div>
     <h2>Watercolor</h2>
     <div class="div8">
       <p>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/John_Martin_-_Manfred_on_the_Jungfrau_%281837%29.jpg/220px-John_Martin_-_Manfred_on_the_Jungfrau_%281837%29.jpg"
         alt="Manfred on the Jungfrau" title="Manfred on the Jungfrau" class="img2" />
         Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle.
         The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include papyrus, bark papers,
         plastics, vellum or leather, fabric, wood and canvas. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush
         painting or scroll painting. In Chinese, Korean, and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome
         black or browns. India, Ethiopia and other countries also have long traditions. Finger-painting with watercolor paints
         originated in China. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry.
      </p>
     </div>
     <h2>Ink</h2>
     <div class="div8">
       <p>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Landscapes_of_the_Four_Seasons.jpg/220px-Landscapes_of_the_Four_Seasons.jpg"
          alt="Landscapes of the Four Seasons" title="Landscapes of the Four Seasons" class="img2" />
         Ink paintings are done with a liquid that contains pigments and/or dyes and is used to color a surface to produce an image,
         text, or design. Ink is used for drawing with a pen, brush, or quill. Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents,
         pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter, fluorescers, and other materials.
         The components of inks serve many purposes;
         the ink’s carrier, colorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its appearance when dry.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Hot wax or encaustic</h2>
    <div class="div8">
      <p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Encaustic-Angel-.jpg/220px-Encaustic-Angel-.jpg"
        alt="Encaustic Angel" title="Encaustic Angel" class="img2" />
        Encaustic painting, also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added.
        The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used.
        The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be
        used—some containing other types of waxes, damar resin, linseed oil, or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be
        purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment. Metal tools and special brushes can be
        used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto
        the surface.
        Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Fresco</h2>
    <div class="div8">
      <p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Meister_von_Mileseva_001.jpg/220px-Meister_von_Mileseva_001.jpg"
        alt="White Angel" title="White Angel" class="img2" />
        Fresco is any of several related mural painting types, done on plaster on walls or ceilings. The word fresco comes from the
        Italian word affresco [afˈfresːko], which derives from the Latin word for fresh. Frescoes were often made during the
        Renaissance and other early time periods. Buon fresco technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin
        layer of wet, fresh lime mortar or plaster, for which the Italian word for plaster, intonaco, is used. A secco painting,
        in contrast, is done on dry plaster (secco is "dry" in Italian).
        The pigments require a binding medium, such as egg (tempera), glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Gouache</h2>
    <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Friedrich_Schwinge_Selbstportrait_im_Garten.jpg/120px-Friedrich_Schwinge_Selbstportrait_im_Garten.jpg"
      alt="Self-portrait, Friedrich Schwinge" title="Self-portrait, Friedrich Schwinge" class="img2"/>
      Gouache is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method.
      Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an
      additional, inert, white pigment such as chalk is also present.
      This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all watermedia, it is diluted with water.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Enamel</h2>
    <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Medallion_St_Demetrios_Louvre_OA6457.jpg/280px-Medallion_St_Demetrios_Louvre_OA6457.jpg"
      alt="Cloisonné Byzantine enamel" title="Cloisonné Byzantine enamel" class="img2" />
      Enamels are made by painting a substrate, typically metal, with frit, a type of powdered glass. Minerals called color oxides
      provide coloration. After firing at a temperature of 750–850 degrees Celsius (1380–1560 degrees Fahrenheit), the result is a fused
      lamination of glass and metal.
      Enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects,[21] but have also been used for other purposes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Spray paint</h2>
  <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d9/95/c7/d995c72b1d1841a70a25ba2a8d3fdd03--spray-paint-canvas-spray-painting.jpg"
       alt="Spray painting" title="Spray painting" class="img2"/>
      Aerosol paint (also called spray paint) is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in
      a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated
      surface. Standard
      sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Tempera</h2>
  <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Duccio_The-Madonna-and-Child-128.jpg/220px-Duccio_The-Madonna-and-Child-128.jpg"
       alt="Madonna and Child by Duccio, tempera and gold on wood" title="Madonna and Child by Duccio, tempera and gold on wood" class="img2" />
      Tempera, also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a
      water-soluble binder medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other size). Tempera also refers to the
      paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the first centuries CE still exist.
      Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Water miscible oil paint</h2>
  <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="http://www.nerdygaga.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/water-miscible-oil-300x200.jpg"
       alt=">Water miscible oil paint" title=">Water miscible oil painting" class="img2" />
      Water miscible oil paints (also called "water soluble" or "water-mixable") is a modern variety of oil paint engineered to be
      thinned and cleaned up with water, rather than having to use chemicals such as turpentine. It can be mixed and applied using the
      same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags
      with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from
      the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Digital painting</h2>
  <div class="div8">
    <p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/The_Woman_of_Rock.png/169px-The_Woman_of_Rock.png"
       alt="Digital painting" title="Digital painting" class="img2" />
      Digital painting is a method of creating an art object (painting) digitally and/or a technique for making digital art in the
      computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as acrylic paint, oils, ink,
      watercolor, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester etc.
      by means of computer software driving industrial robotic or office machinery (printers). As a technique, it refers to a
      computer graphics software program that uses a virtual canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer,
      and which give a digital artwork a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way.
